As you answer these questions, remember to make explicit references to your
code.  For example, don't just say, "I did such and so;" instead say, "I did
such and so on main.cpp:13-15."  You may use the notation file:line or
file:line:col to refer to places in your code.

1.  Explain why your queue is thread-safe.  Tell, for each operation supported
    by the queue (i.e., public method), what steps you took to make it
    thread-safe.  Tell why are sure no one may bypass your safeguards to cause
    race conditions.

2.  How many threads did you create to handle requests?  Why did you select
    this number?  Be sure to reference where in your code you create the
    threads.

3.  You should have had at least three global variables in your program: the
    word list, the distance table, and the cache.  List, for each of these
    variables, what steps you took to ensure that all accesses to them were
    thread-safe.  Explain your reasoning.

4.  Explain why your map is thread-safe.  Tell, for each operation supported
    by the map (i.e., public method), what steps you took to make it
    thread-safe.  Tell why you can be sure no one may bypass your safeguards
    to cause race conditions.

5.  Where in your code do you read and update the cache?  How much
    syncrhonization do you expect for these operations: how likely are they to
    block?

6.  Explain your strategy for removing entries from the cache.  Explain why
    your approach is thread-safe.

7.  I asked you to create a second map to store timestamps.  Another option
    would have been to store the timestamps in the cache along with the
    results.  Explain the difference between these two operations in terms of
    synchronization: is one approach more likely to cause blocking than
    another?

8.  (Optional) Tell me something interesting you learned from doing this
    project.

9.  (Optional) Tell me something you didn't like about this project.  Was it
    something you think should be changed about the project, or just
    something inherently difficult about the project?

10. (Optional) Tell me something about your implementation that you are proud
    of.  For example, something that was difficult to do but that you
    eventually figured out; something that you feel you did particularly well;
    or something that you did that was beyond what was asked.
