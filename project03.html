    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      For this project we will be adding features to a spell-checking web
      service.  We will use
      the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html">Boost.Asio</a>
      library to create a simple HTTP server.  (The original code for the HTTP
      server comes
      from <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost_asio/examples/cpp11_examples.html">
      the Boost web site</a>; I have modified it some for this project.) In
      order to keep the service responsive, we will implement a simple thread
      pool for handling requests.  We will also implement a cache to be shared
      across all threads.
    </p>
    <h3>Preparations</h3>
    <p>
      For this project we will be using Boost's asynchronous I/O library,
      Boost.Asio, to create a simple HTTP server.  This open source library,
      along with its documentation, is available from
      the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk">Boost web
      site</a>.  However, I recommend you add the library to your project in
      Visual Studio 2015 using NuGet.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, create a project for a Win32 Console Application.  Then open the
      &ldquo;Project&rdquo; menu and select &ldquo;Manage NuGet
      Packages&hellip;&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <img style="width:70ex" src="boost/menu.png"/>
    <p>
      Boost is a very large collection of libraries, so instead of installing
      the whole thing I recommend that you install only the components needed
      by the Asio library: the system, regular expression, and date/time
      libraries.  These correspond to
      the <code>boost_system</code>, <code>boost_regex</code>,
      and <code>boost_date_time</code> packages, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      To install the <code>boot_system</code> package, first select the
      &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; tab, then enter &ldquo;boost_system&rdquo; into the
      search box.  The package of the same name should appear at the top of
      the list.  Select this package, then click the &ldquo;Install&rdquo;
      button in the panel on the right.
    </p>
    <img style="width:120ex" src="boost/boost_system.png"/>
    <p>
      Note that the package may take a few minutes to install depending on
      your internet and computer speed.  Wait until the &ldquo;Finished&rdquo;
      line appears in the &ldquo;Output&rdquo; window at the bottom before
      proceeding.
    </p>
    <img style="width:120ex" src="boost/finished.png"/>
    <p>
      The <code>boost_regex</code> and <code>boost_date_time</code> packages
      are installed in a similar manner.  After you have finished, selecting
      the &ldquo;Installed&rdquo; tab should show the three packages installed
      along with the <code>boost</code> package which includes the header
      files needed to use the Boost library.  (The <code>boost</code> package
      is installed automatically as a dependency of the other packages.)
    </p>
    <img style="width:120ex" src="boost/installed.png"/>
    <p>
      When compiling your project with Boost you may notice that you get
      warning messages that read, &ldquo;<code>Please define _WIN32_WINNT or
      _WIN32_WINDOWS appropriately</code>.&rdquo; You can safely ignore this
      message, but if you would like to fix it then add the string
      &ldquo;<code>_WIN32_WINNT=0x0603</code>&rdquo; to the preprocessor
      directives in your project properties.
    </p>
    <img style="width:110ex" src="boost/preprocessor.png"/>
    <h3>Starting point</h3>
    <p>
      I have provided you with a starting point to use for this project.
      Download <a href="boost/SpellServerStart.zip">the zip file</a> and
      extract it to your project directory.  Add all <kbd>.cpp</kbd>
      and <kbd>.hpp</kbd> files to your project.  Most of these files you can
      safely ignore; however, you should take a look at these two:
    </p>
    <h4><kbd>main.cpp</kbd></h4>
    <p>
      This is the file which contains your <code>main()</code> function, which
      you can see below.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:cpp first-line:58">// Initialize and run server
int main()
{
	try
	{
		std::cout << "Listening on port 8000..." << std::endl;
		http::server::server s("localhost", "8000", handle_request);
		s.run();
	}
	catch (std::exception& e)
	{
		std::cerr << "exception: " << e.what() << "\n";
	}

	return 0;
}</pre>
    <p>
      This function creates a server on line 64, then runs it on line 65.
      Because this is a single-threaded application, the call
      to <code>s.run()</code> will not return until the server has finished
      running.  You can stop the server from running by
      pressing <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that anything in the <code>http::server</code> namespace comes from
      the other files in the starting point of this project; if you want to
      see the definition of the <code>server</code> class you can look in the
      file <kbd>server.hpp</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, look at the function <code>handle_request</code>, found below.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:cpp first-line:45">// Called by server whenever a request is received
// Must fill in reply, then call done()
void handle_request(const http::server::request& req, http::server::reply& rep, http::server::done_callback done) {
	std::cout << req.method << ' ' << req.uri << std::endl;
	if (req.path == "/spell") {
		spellcheck_request(req, rep);
	}
	else {
		rep = http::server::reply::stock_reply(http::server::reply::not_found);
	}
	done();
}</pre>
    <p>
      Notice that this function is given to the server when we create it
      in <code>main</code> (line 64).  This function will be called by the server any
      time an HTTP request is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing this function does is to print a report of the request
      to <code>cout</code> (line 48); this is a very simplistic logging
      mechanism.  Next it examines the path requested and decides on a
      function to call to handle the request.  In this case we only have a
      single path which is mapped to a function: a request
      for <code>/spell</code> will result in
      calling <code>spellcheck_request</code> (line 50).
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll notice that the <code>handle_request</code> function takes three
      parameters.  The first is a constant request object; this contains
      information about the request being made.  The second is a reply object;
      this object is used to generate your response to the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third parameter is a function to call once you have finished
      handling the request.  Because we are implementing this web server
      asynchronously, it will not assume that the response is ready just
      because <code>handle_request</code> has finished.  You must call
      the <code>done</code> function to indicate the reply is ready to be
      written out.  You can see this on line 55.  This asynchronous approach
      will be important as we make this web server multi-threaded, because it
      will allow us to pass off the request to another thread; that other
      thread can simply invoke <code>done</code> when it has finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, look at the function <code>spellcheck_request</code>, shown below.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:cpp first-line:22">// Handle request by doing spell check on query string
// Render results as JSON
void spellcheck_request(const http::server::request& req, http::server::reply& rep) {
	// Set up reply
	rep.status = http::server::reply::status_type::ok;
	rep.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json";

	// Loop over spellcheck results
	bool first = true;
	rep.content << "[";
	for (auto& candidate : spell::spellcheck(req.query)) {
		if (first) {
			first = false;
		}
		else {
			rep.content << ", ";
		}
		rep.content << "\n  {word: \"" << candidate.word
			<< "\", distance: " << candidate.distance << "}";
	}
	rep.content << "\n]";
}</pre>
    <p>
      This function handles the request for our spell-checking web service by
      filling in the request object it received as a parameter.  Notice that
      it sets the status code for the request on line 26, fills in
      the <code>Content-Type</code> header on line 27, then writes the
      response to the <code>content</code> on lines 30&ndash;42.  The class
      definitions for <code>request</code> and <code>reply</code> can be found
      in the files <kbd>request.hpp</kbd> and <kbd>reply.hpp</kbd>,
      respectively.
    </p>
    <h4><kbd>spell.cpp</kbd></h4>
    <p>
      This file contains the code that performs the spell checking.  It uses a
      &ldquo;brute-force&rdquo; algorithm, calculating the edit distance
      between the word to be spell-checked and each of the words in the word
      list.  (I had no interest in optimizing this algorithm since (1) it is
      not the point of the assignment, and (2) a less-efficient algorithm
      increases the need for running in parallel.)
    </p>
    <p>
      What you need to notice about this file is that it contains two global
      variables.  The first is the word list, declared on line 38, as shown
      below.  This is really just a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> which I
      turned into its own class so that I could initialize it in the
      constructor.  Note that this list of words will never change throughout
      the life of the program.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:cpp first-line:38">  const WordList wordlist;</pre>
    <p>
      The second global variable is a table of integers used by the
      spell-checking algorithm.  The edit-distance algorithm uses dynamic
      programming techniques, and thus requires calculating answers for all
      intermediate steps.  Rather than dynamically allocating a table for
      every spell-check request, I create a global table and reuse it for each
      request.  This variable is declared on line 60, as shown below
    </p>
    <pre class="brush:cpp first-line:60">  DistanceTable table</pre>
    <p>
      You need to be aware of these global variables so that you can handle
      them correctly when multi-threading.
    </p>
    <h3>Running the Program</h3>
    <p>
      Run the program as you would any console application.  It will take a
      few seconds to load the word list; then it should report that it is
      listenting on port 8000.  As program runs you should see output on the
      console reporting what requests it has received.
    </p>
    <img src="boost/console.png" style="width:120ex"/>
    <p>
      You may test the program using a browser.  Simply go to the
      address <code>http://localhost:8000/spell?<var>word</var></code>,
      where <var>word</var> is the word you wish to spell check.  It will take
      several seconds, but eventually you should get back a response in the
      JSON format listing the twenty words with shortest edit distance to the
      word you queried.
    </p>
    <img src="boost/browser.png" style="width:120ex"/>
    <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>(35%)</i> Design a thread-safe work queue.  The queue should have
          enqueue and dequeue operations which use a mutex internally to make
          them thread safe.  If the queue is empty, the dequeue operation
          should use a condition variable to wait until there is something on
          the queue&mdash;i.e., the dequeue operation blocks until it has
          something to return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your program should create a global work queue to hold requests.
          When your web server gets a request, it should package up everything
          needed to handle the request and put it in the queue.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>(35%)</i> Your web service should use
          the <code>thread::hardware_concurrency</code> function to select an
          appropriate number of request_queue threads.  These threads should be
          created at the beginning of the program.  The threads should
          continually check the work queue and handle the requests they find
          there.  When the main thread finishes (because the user presses
          <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>) then these threads may be killed; you do not have
          to wait for them to finish what they are doing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>(10%)</i> Decide the proper way to handle the global variables
          in <kbd>spell.cpp</kbd>.  Can these variables be shared across all
          threads?  Should they be made <code>thread_local</code>?  Should
          they be protected by a mutex?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>(10%)</i> Design a thread-safe map.  The map should support both
          read and write operations which use a shared mutex internally to
          make them thread safe.  Read operations should use a shared lock so
          that multiple read operations can occur at the same time.  Write
          operations should use an exclusive lock.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>(5%)</i> Create an instance of your map class to use as a cache.
          When you first receive a spell-check request, look in the cache to
          see if the results are already there.  If so, use them; if not,
          proceed with the spell-checking algorithm, then store the
          results in the cache to be used for future requests.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>(5%)</i> Add a second map which maps words to timestamps.  Each
          time you receive a spell-check request, update the timestamp for the
          word requested.  Thus, the map should tell us the <em>last</em> time
          a particular word was requested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a second web service at the path <code>/cachedump</code> that
          returns the contents of this second map as JSON.  This web service
          will tell you what strings are in the cache and how long it has been
          since they have been accessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make a thread which wakes up once a minute.  The thread should check
          both maps and remove from them any entries for words which have not
          been requested in over a minute.  While this is an overly-aggressive
          cache-cleaning strategy, it should make it easy to observe the
          thread in action.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Project Report</h3>
    <p>
      Your grade for this project will be based on two things.  The first is
      some test cases I will run to see if your program behaves as expected.
      The second is your project report.  You should download
      the <a href="project01report.txt">list of questions</a> I have provided
      and fill in the answers.  Please submit your report as a plain text file
      along with the source code to your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing your report, please be <dfn>thorough</dfn>&mdash;provide a
      full answer to the question, not just a one-sentence summary; and
      please be <dfn>succinct</dfn>&mdash;explain your answer directly and
      without repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no need to answer questions which address parts of the program
      you did not do.  However, a particularly good answer may result in you
      getting a few points even though you did not do that part of the
      program.  Questions which are labeled optional are completely optional;
      you will not loose any points for skipping them nor receive any points
      for completing them.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Submission</h3>
    <p>
      You will turn in two files for this project.  The first is a zip file
      containing all source code files which you have edited or created for
      this project.  Source files which you have left unchanged do not need to
      be submitted.  Do not submit other project files.  The second file to
      submit is your project report.  This should be a plain text file.
    </p>
